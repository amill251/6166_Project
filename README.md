#### Iteration 1 :

We have implemented basic web video application using WebRTC. We have used Agora RTM SDK for the signalling process and importing some basic functionalities of the multimedia sessions. We have to run the uploaded JS file in branch group 5 iteration 1 which will setup the video session. The SDK imports all the packages necessary for the functionality of the multimedia messaging communication. This is a basic working application using WebRTC protocol.

1. Run the main.JS file in Visual Studio code.
2. It will take you to the local browser where camera access is requested.
3. Once camera access is allowed , you can see two users on the browser screen communicating over the network.
4. The signalling process is enabled by the SDK which will enable the video multimedia sessions.
