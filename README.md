•	Introduction about the selected project
We, as a group decided to take-up WebRTC project. We are going to develop application using python. We are going to combine WebRTC and application and deploy it. WebRTC includes a set of APIs and protocols that allow browsers to capture, transmit and receive audio, video, and data streams in real-time. It also enables peer-to-peer communication, making it suitable for video conferencing, voice calls, file sharing, and other real-time communication applications.

•	Project plan based on two weeks iteration.
We are going to use the existing WebRTC framework to develop a mobile application using stream lit and test it by deploying it in coming two weeks iteration.
