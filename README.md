## Introduction about the selected project
We are going to do a project on 3D human modeling with WebRTC using a Python/Flask server backend and an Android front-end client. Here is a quick example video on Flask and WebRTC from YouTube that we might build off of to aid in our project.

The server code is going to be deployed to a cloud service such as Heroku, AWS, or GCP, and we will use the WebRTC protocals to stream video data, that we will then send up to the server for processing. The server is also going to be running an AI engine, to do the human modeling. This github repo shows some of the code that we will use for the AI models

## What architecture you intend to use (client-server or standalone mobile application)
We plan on using a client-server model, with a Python/Flask server and an Android app as the client.

## Project plan based on two weeks iteration.
### Week 1:
1.	Research and gather requirements for the project
2.	Set up the WebRTC environment and infrastructure
3.	Implement the basic WebRTC functionality, including peer-to-peer communication, signal server setup, and data transfer
4.	Conduct initial testing of the WebRTC implementation
### Week 2:
1.	Integrate reinforcement learning into the WebRTC environment
2.	Design the reward system and implement the Q-Learning algorithm
3.	Conduct initial testing of the reinforcement learning functionality
4.  Conduct initial tesing of android app connecting to server via WebRTC
### Week 3-4:
1.	Refine the reinforcement learning algorithm based on the results of the initial testing
2.	Integrate additional WebRTC functionality, such as video and audio transmission
3.	Conduct further testing and debugging of the entire system
4.  Implement a video stream coming from the Android app
### Week 5-6:
1.	Finalize the reinforcement learning algorithm based on the results of testing
2.	Optimize the WebRTC environment for improved performance and scalability
3.	Conduct final testing and debugging of the entire system
4.  Connect the video stream to the Server via the WebRTC

### Week 7:
1.	Prepare for deployment and finalize any remaining tasks
2.	Complete documentation for the project.
3.	Deliver the final project and upload it onto canvas.
